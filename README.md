**This is a custom fork of Harmony used by the Stardew Valley community.** It's bundled with
[SMAPI](https://github.com/Pathoschild/SMAPI) automatically. See
[pardeike/Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony) for documentation and usage.

This fork is identical to Harmony 1.2.0.1, except that generated method names include the original
type and the patching Harmony IDs to help troubleshoot error logs:
```c#
// with original Harmony
   at resetLocalState_Patch1(Object )
   at StardewValley.GameLocation.<resetForPlayerEntry>b__219_0()
   ...

// with fork
   at StardewValley.Farm.resetLocalState_PatchedBy<Pathoschild.SmallBeachFarm>(Object )
   at StardewValley.GameLocation.<resetForPlayerEntry>b__219_0()
   ...
```
